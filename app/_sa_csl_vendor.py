"""Vendored from Sunflower AI's **SUD-spaCy** repo, ``scripts/sa_tokenizer.py`` (MIT,
Copyright (c) 2026 Sunflower AI — the same owner as this app, so the vendoring is a
convenience, not a licence question; the header is kept for provenance).

That script is the *input front-end* of the Sanskrit parser package
``sa_sud_vedic_ufal_csl``: it normalises Devanagari / accented Vedic IAST to the
treebank's unaccented IAST and then **reverses the CSL-marked sandhi** — the notation in
which this app's Sanskrit ``# text`` lines are written (``vartm" â-punar-janmanām``,
``pralay'-ôdbhava``, ``hor" êty``). Everything below is upstream's, verbatim, with exactly
two edits:

  * the two ``from spacy…`` imports and the ``SanskritInputTokenizer`` class + registry
    factory below ``desandhi_csl`` are dropped — this app needs the *text* transform, not
    a spaCy ``Doc``, and must not gain a spaCy import on a path that has to work with no
    model installed at all;
  * this docstring replaces upstream's.

Why a copy rather than an import: the SUD-spaCy checkout is a sibling working tree, not a
dependency, and the parser wheel that *does* carry this module may not be installed (see
``app/sa_csl.py``). The app must align Sanskrit standalone. Kept isolated in ``app/`` with
the leading underscore, exactly as ``app/_toolbox_vendor.py`` is, so every use of it goes
through the one façade ``app/sa_csl.py``.

Sync note: upstream's ``desandhi_csl`` is the SAME routine ``revert_csl_sandhi.py`` runs
over the corpus, so the model's training data and this file must not drift apart. If the
model's tokenisation of a CSL text ever stops matching what this produces, re-copy from
upstream rather than patching here. Vendored from md5 b8d3e87cfc5ea1b56f4e2ff7a2dd0087.

# Reverse the CSL sandhi, normalising each word toward its **pre-pausal (pausa) form** — the shape
# it takes in isolation — so the parser sees ONE canonical wordform regardless of the following
# context (and training data + runtime tokeniser stay in step, since `revert_csl_sandhi.py` calls
# this same routine). Operates on the ordered token list (every junction is a two-token affair).
# Undone:
#   (1) the *notation-marked* junctions — vowel coalescence (' / " on the left, â ê î ô û / macron
#       on the right) and avagraha — reversible exactly (`_restore_pair` etc.);
#   (2) the DETERMINISTIC external sandhi — recoverable WITHOUT a lexicon, because CSL keeps word
#       boundaries and marks coalescence, and because pausa reductions that PRESERVE place of
#       articulation are unique (`_rev_visarga_vowel`, `_rev_final_consonant`). Applied:
#         • ayādi glide before a vowel  ->  the diphthong/mid vowel: -ay/-av/-āy/-āv -> -e/-o/-ai/-au
#           (te i- -> tay i-; tau a- -> tāv a-). Unambiguous because external_sandhi KEEPS the glide
#           (e+V -> ay V, not bare hiatus): a vowel-then-glide is ayādi, a CONSONANT-then-glide is
#           yaṇ, and a bare vowel is visarga;
#         • yaṇ glide before a vowel  ->  the short vowel: -Cy/-Cv -> -Ci/-Cu (ity a- -> iti a-,
#           tanv a- -> tanu a-). The i/ī, u/ū LENGTH is not recoverable from y/v, so the short vowel
#           is taken as the default (iti, not itī) — a deliberate, small loss for the common case;
#         • -a/-ā in HIATUS before a vowel  ->  -aḥ/-āḥ  (a genuine -a/-ā + V would have coalesced and
#           been marked, and ayādi keeps its glide, so a bare -a/-ā + V can only be a dropped visarga);
#         • the guṇa of a following vocalic ṛ/ḷ (-a/-ā + ṛ -> -ar, `_rev_guna_r`): a word2-initial r/l
#           before a CONSONANT  ->  ṛ/ḷ  (ca rṣiḥ -> ca ṛṣiḥ, etayā rcā -> etayā ṛcā). Word1 keeps its
#           own vowel in this junction, so — unlike coalescence — nothing is marked; the cue is on
#           word2, and it is unambiguous because no native Sanskrit word can begin r/l + consonant;
#         • -o before avagraha  ->  -aḥ  (namo 'stu -> namaḥ astu), and -o before a voiced consonant
#           ->  -aḥ  (vatso vira- -> vatsaḥ);  [both from -aḥ; the only collision is the -u-stem
#           vocative in -o (viṣṇo, ~0.8 %), accepted — the model being for classical prose];
#         • word-final -s and -r (after a vowel)  ->  visarga -ḥ  (tatas -> tataḥ, punar -> punaḥ,
#           agnir -> agniḥ);  every Sanskrit word-final s/r goes to visarga at pause;
#         • voiced stop -d/-g/-b  ->  -t/-k/-p  (dental/velar/labial voice neutralised: tad -> tat,
#           id -> it);  place is preserved, so this is unique;
#         • anusvara -ṃ before a non-sibilant consonant  ->  -m;  gemination -nn  ->  -n.
#         • CONTEXT-SENSITIVE sibilant/palatal junctions, gated by a small gold-derived lexicon of
#           genuine consonant-final / ch-initial stems (`_rev_sibilant_and_c`, lexica _SIB_FINAL /
#           _C_FINAL / _J_FINAL / _L_FINAL / _CH_INITIAL): word-final -ś before c/ch and -ṣ before ṭ/ṭh
#           are visarga (kratuś ca -> kratuḥ ca) unless a genuine -ś/-ṣ stem (diś, haviṣ); word-final
#           -c/-j/-l before their trigger are -t (tac ca -> tat ca, taj jal- -> tat jal-, tal l- ->
#           tat l-) unless a genuine stem (vāc, rāj, the -añc directionals); and the ch of a -c ch-
#           junction is ś (paṭhec chiva -> paṭhet śiva) unless a genuine ch-word (chāyā). -ñc is
#           structurally always genuine (t+c never yields -ñc).
#         • LAW OF FINALS / avasāna (stage 3, `_rev_law_of_finals` + `_LAW_OF_FINALS`): a genuine
#           consonant-final stem is normalised to its pausa form — vāc -> vāk, ṛc -> ṛk, pratyañc ->
#           pratyaṅ, diś -> dik, viś -> viṭ, rāj -> rāṭ, yuj -> yuk, haviṣ -> haviḥ, ṣaṣ -> ṣaṭ. Place
#           is LEXICAL (diś->k vs viś->ṭ; rāj->ṭ vs yuj->k), so it is a per-stem map (Whitney §141-2 +
#           gold). Applied to compound members too (prāc- -> prāk-) — one pre-pausal form per stem.
#   NOT reverted — genuinely ambiguous even WITH the lexicon: the remaining aspirate finals -h, the
#   hapax -ṣ stem dadhṛṣ (uncertain place), and a word-final segment before a non-triggering one (place
#   unrecoverable there: diś -> dik but viś -> viṭ), and a -ā/-a before a voiced consonant (a dropped
#   -āḥ/-aḥ is indistinguishable from a genuine final vowel there). These stay on the surface. Measured
#   on Vedic (round-trip through external_sandhi against gold): the bare-hiatus visarga rule is 100 %
#   clean (5922/5922 genuine visarga — ayādi no longer collides with it), the ayādi glide reversal
#   round-trips exactly, and the lexicon-gated sibilant/-c junctions are 100 % on the gold (word2
#   1668/1668; the -ś/-ṣ and -c guards 1230+438 with zero genuine-stem mangling). NB the paired forward
#   engine `external_sandhi.py` must keep the ayādi glide (e+V -> ay, not bare hiatus) for this to hold.
#
#   PUNCTUATION. Every junction rule above except the two COALESCENT ones (the marked vowel coalescence
#   of stage 1 and the guṇa ṛ/ḷ of `_rev_guna_r`) looks for its neighbour through sentence-medial
#   punctuation (`_MEDIAL_PUNCT`, `_next_word`): non-coalescent external sandhi applies right across an
#   editorial comma or quotation mark, which a CSL edition lays over a phonological chain that does not
#   pause there (tataś, ca <- tataḥ ca;  vatso, vipra- <- vatsaḥ vipra-;  kiṃ, bhadre <- kim bhadre).
#   The coalescent two are kept strictly adjacent, since coalescence fuses the two vowels into a single
#   syllable and no mark can sit inside it. A sentence-final mark or a daṇḍa is a PAUSE: it blocks every
#   rule, because the words flanking it already stand in pausa form — which also settles the anusvara: a
#   -ṃ at a pause is a GENUINE anusvara (oṃ) and is left alone, exactly as at end of input and before a
#   vowel, since an edition writes final m as -m before a pause (Devanagari virāma). NB this is a fix
#   in passing: before the pause/medial split a daṇḍa counted as an ordinary following consonant, so
#   `oṃ ‖` was reduced to `om` while a sentence-final `oṃ` was not.
